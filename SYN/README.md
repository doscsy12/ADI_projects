## Synthetic data generation (SYN)

### Introduction
There are many techniques utilised for synthetic data generation, and we need to have a thorough understanding of their effectiveness, the assessment of statistical similarities, and the maintenance of data integrity. Central to performing a systematic review is the examination of the robustness and reliability of the algorithms utilized. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), while known for their potential, are notoriously hard to train, and susceptible to instability issues such as divergence, which pose risks to the authenticity of their outputs. Furthermore, evaluating the fidelity of generated samples remains an ongoing challenge, as conventional metrics may inadequately capture certain characteristics present in real datasets.  

### Aim 
So, the aim of performing a systematic review is to navigate through these complexities, and to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and limitations of synthetic data generation techniques in the financial domain.

#### Systematic review 
A systematic literature review was conducted to examine existing research on synthetic data generation techniques within the financial domain. This method includes defining the research, defining article search method, and analysis of the results after full text screening of selected articles. The results of this process will inform the development of our algorithms aimed at accurately and reliably replicating financial transactions.
