## Route optimisation using geospatial framework for transport vehicles 

### Introduction
Route optimization is the process of determining the most cost-efficient route based on time, distance, etc. Since other relevant factors, such as the number and location of all the required stops, as well as time window during transportation, it is more complex than simply finding the shortest path between the origin and destination. 

### Aim
The aim is to develop an algorithm to optimize routes in a multi-stop booking reservations to minimize total travel time, total distance, etc.
