## Banknote Authentication
### Background
Despite the rise of digital payments, cash is still widely used in many Asian countries, especially in rural areas and informal economies. This is due to:
<br> (1) Limited access to banking or digital infrastructure.
<br> (2) Cash being faster and more trusted in low-tech or low-income communities.
<br> (3) Preference for anonymity and control over spending.

### Aim
Aim is to develop a reliable and accurate system for authenticating banknotes using ML techniques, with the objective of detecting counterfeit currency by analyzing key features such as texture, variance, skewness, and image-based properties.
