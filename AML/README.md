## Fraud detection using graph analytics

### Introduction
Graph analytics can be used to obtain more context characterized by a network of interconnected transactions between accounts or parties. This has emerged at the forefront of a new technology to support anti-money laundering analysis because money laundering involves transaction-flow relationships between various entities (in the form of a network).

<br> The use of graph analytics can complement traditional machine learning techniques by overcoming the challenge of uncovering relationships in a massive, complex and interconnected dataset. Another advantage of using graph based methods is that the method is channel/platform dependent and are more adaptive than rule-based systems and more expressive than traditional statistical methods. According to Interpol, most financial crimes are cross-border, or trans-national in nature. Graph analytics will provide the information needed to understand interconnectivity-based analysis at a wider or global scale. 

**Aim**
Thus, the aim of this project is to explore application of network analytics and graph theory for fraud detection.
